#  Energy Consumption Optimization in Smart Buildings (IoT + Arduino)

##  Overview
This project demonstrates how to **monitor and optimize energy consumption** in a smart building environment using **Arduino UNO**, **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module**, and **IoT sensors**.  
It automates lights and fans based on occupancy and temperature, displays real-time data on an LCD, and uploads sensor readings to the cloud for remote monitoring.


##  Features
-  Temperature & humidity monitoring (DHT11)
-  Occupancy detection (PIR sensor)
-  Automatic control of lighting and fan via 2-channel relay
-  Real-time 16×2 LCD display
-  IoT integration using ESP8266 (ThingSpeak / Blynk)
-  Estimated 20–30 % reduction in energy use
-  Extendable for AI-based prediction in future versions.
